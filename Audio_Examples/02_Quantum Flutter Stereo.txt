Quantum Flutter Stereo: A Technical Overview
This Praat script generates a reverse exponential crescendo tail effect through stochastic impulse convolution with triple-layer synthesis, creating diffuse reverberation textures that grow from silence into density.
Core Process
The script appends a silent duration to your input audio, then populates this tail with probabilistically distributed impulses that undergo exponential amplitude growth and sinusoidal modulation. The original signal is convolved with this designed impulse response and layered with itself to create a complex, swelling reverberant cloud.
Technical Operations

Tail Extension and Channel Separation

A user-defined silent duration (default 1 second) is concatenated to the input audio, creating space for the effect to bloom independently of the source material.
For stereo inputs, channels are extracted and processed with slightly different parameters to create spatial width and decorrelation.

Poisson Process Impulse Generation

Random impulse timing is generated using a Poisson distribution with controllable density (default 800 events per second).
Each impulse becomes a narrow pulse (default 0.08ms width, 1200Hz period), creating a base texture of granular clicks.
The Poisson process ensures irregular, non-periodic spacing—avoiding the metallic resonance of evenly-spaced impulses.

Reverse Exponential Amplitude Envelope

The impulse train undergoes exponential amplitude scaling that grows from near-silence to full amplitude over the tail duration.
Formula structure: amplitude = base^((time-start)/(end-start)-1)
Default base value of 120 creates a dramatic crescendo curve, with most energy concentrated in the final moments.
This inverts traditional reverb decay, producing an anti-causal effect where density builds rather than dissipates.

Complex Modulation Layer

Nested sinusoidal modulation adds temporal fluctuation to the impulse amplitudes.
Primary modulation: 60Hz cosine wave with 0.6 depth (creates subtle pulsation)
Secondary modulation: 3Hz sine wave modulates the phase of the primary (adds irregular warble)
This prevents static texture, introducing flutter and shimmer reminiscent of tape wow or Doppler shift.

Convolution with Source Material

The modulated impulse response is convolved with the original audio signal, creating a diffuse reflection network.
Convolution output is scaled to 0.35 amplitude (35% wet signal) to maintain source intelligibility.
Convolution effectively smears the source material across the stochastic impulse grid, fragmenting transients and blurring pitch.

Triple Layer Architecture

Layer 1: Original dry signal (full amplitude)
Layer 2: Attenuated copy of original (0.7 amplitude) for body and warmth
Layer 3: Convolved impulse response (0.35 amplitude) for diffusion and growth
All three layers are summed, then converted to mono (or kept as decorrelated stereo pairs), creating dense harmonic interaction.

Stereo Differentiation (for stereo sources)

Left and right channels receive distinct processing:

Left: 800 impulses/second, 4-second Poisson range, 120 exponential base
Right: 750 impulses/second, 3.8-second range, 115 exponential base, shifted modulation phase

These micro-variations prevent channel correlation, widening the stereo image and creating spatial movement.

Fadeout and Peak Limiting

A cosine-shaped fadeout (default 1 second) is applied to the final moments, preventing abrupt cutoff.
Peak amplitude is limited to 0.88 to avoid clipping while preserving dynamic intensity.
Compositional Implications
From speech or any source material, this process:

Creates phantom reverberation that defies acoustic physics: reflections precede the dry signal's end, building impossibly
Transforms transient-rich material (consonants, percussive attacks) into sustained clouds through convolutive smearing
Generates rhythmic complexity from static sources: the Poisson impulses create micro-rhythmic fluttering independent of input timing
Produces spectral thickening: convolution redistributes harmonics across the impulse train's frequency response
Establishes dramatic formal arcs: the reverse crescendo provides built-in compositional trajectory from whisper to roar

The effect sits between granular synthesis, convolution reverb, and stochastic multiplication. Unlike natural reverberation (which decays), Quantum Flutter grows—making it ideal for transitions, buildups, or inverting speech's natural envelope where phonemes typically fade.
The triple-layer architecture ensures the source remains anchored while the convolved layer blooms around it, creating a sound that simultaneously occupies foreground (dry signal) and diffuse background (convolved tail).
Stereo processing maintains spatial coherence while introducing subtle binaural instability, as if the reverberant field itself is rotating or phasing.
